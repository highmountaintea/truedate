# TrueDate - Functional approach to JS date

Still under development. But date should be functional.

## Purpose

JavaScript Date() is lacking, and is a constant source of bug. There are libraries on npm that attempt to solve the Date() problem,
but I feel some of them are too heavy, while some of them do not address the real issues that cause bugs. Here is my attempt to
solve it.

## Notes

* `truedate` - represents a date
* `truetime` - represents a date+time

This means `truetime` is the module that is meant to replace JavaScript Date object. `truedate` is meant to represent
strictly date only.

## Status

It is still under heavy development.
